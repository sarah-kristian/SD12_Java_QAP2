# Java Deliverables for Keyin College
Due: February 13, 2025

## Overview
This repository contains the Java projects and assignments for Keyin College. Below are the details of each project along with their specific components and test results.

## Project 1: Shapes

### Problem 1: The MyLine and MyPoint Classes
These classes are used to construct points and lines. `MyPoint` allows the creation of a point in a 2D space, and `MyLine` utilizes two `MyPoint` objects to define a line segment. 
- **Test Output**: [MyLine Test Output](MyLineTest.png)
- **Note**: Tests for the `MyLine` class are included.

### Problem 2: The MyRectangle Class
This class defines a rectangle using the coordinates of its top left (vA) and bottom right (vC) corners, which are instances of the `MyPoint` class. Methods to calculate the perimeter and area are provided.
- **Test Output**: [MyRectangle Test Output](MyRectangleTest.png)
- **Note**: Tests for the `MyRectangle` class are included.

## Project 2: Credit

### Problem 3: CreditCard Class
This class models a credit card using aggregation. It includes `Money` and `Person` objects, with the `Person` object containing an `Address` object. 
- **Demo Output**: [Credit Card Demo Output](CreditCardDemo.png)
- **Note**: Only a demo test for the `CreditCard` class was created.
